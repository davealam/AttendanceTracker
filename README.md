# AttendanceTracker
 
Attendance Tracker application made using Java, JavaFX, and SQLite for data persistence. Utilizes a singleton class for the Employee Repository and the MVC design pattern is used for the program as a whole. Application is used to track Employee sick time (both paid and unpaid), as well as attendance penalty points (for being late, missing work unexcused, etc). Per the attendance policy, points fall off on a rolling 12 month and 24 month basis. This application handles this automatically once points are entered via an easy to use GUI.
